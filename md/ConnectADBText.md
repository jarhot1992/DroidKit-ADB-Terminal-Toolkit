## Advanced Tips

### Multi-Device Management

```bash
# View all connected devices with details
adb devices -l

# Execute command on specific device
adb -s <device_id> shell <command>

# Example:
adb -s 192.168.1.100:5555 shell ls /sdcard/
```

### Multiple Device Connections

```bash
# Connect multiple devices
adb connect 192.168.1.100:5555
adb connect 192.168.1.101:5555

# View all devices
adb devices

# Execute same command on all devices
for device in $(adb devices | tail -n +2 | cut -sf1); do
    adb -s $device shell echo "Hello from $device"
done
```

### Automation Scripts

**Windows Batch Script:**
```batch
@echo off
echo Starting ADB wireless debugging...
adb tcpip 5555
timeout /t 3
adb connect 192.168.1.100:5555
adb devices
pause
```

**Linux/Mac Shell Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting ADB wireless debugging..."
adb tcpip 5555
sleep 3
adb connect 192.168.1.100:5555
adb devices
```

### 🔍 Network Debugging

```bash
# View network information
adb shell ip addr show wlan0

# Check ADB service status
adb shell getprop service.adb.tcp.port

# View ADB processes
adb shell ps | grep adbd
```

### Security Considerations

1. **Use wireless debugging only on trusted networks**
2. **Disable wireless debugging after use**
3. **Regularly check authorized debugging devices**
4. **Avoid using wireless debugging on public Wi-Fi**
5. **Use VPN when debugging over untrusted networks**

### Performance Optimization

```bash
# Optimize ADB performance
adb shell settings put global development_settings_enabled 1
adb shell settings put global adb_enabled 1

# Increase ADB buffer size
adb shell setprop persist.adb.trace_mask 0
```
