3. ##### Why are there ads
    To support the continuous development and maintenance of the app, we rely on advertising revenue. This helps us keep the app running smoothly and improve it over time.

4. ##### Privacy Security
   The app does not collect or upload any personal data. It has been reviewed and approved by Google, and the latest version offers significantly enhanced security compared to older versions.

5. ##### Why are there trackers
   The trackers in the app come from the advertising SDKs, which are used only for measuring ad performance, not for collecting personal data. All SDKs have been reviewed and approved by Google, ensuring that no user information is leaked. We are committed to protecting your privacy and keeping your data safe.

6. ##### How do I unlock my device
    We cannot assist with requests to bypass device security or licensing restrictions. Helping to unlock devices in ways that circumvent passwords, PINs, lock screens, or activation locks may be illegal and can put user data and device integrity at risk.
    For legitimate assistance, please contact the device manufacturer, your carrier, or an authorized service center. They can verify ownership and provide safe, approved methods to regain access (you may be asked to provide proof of purchase or identity).

7. ##### I want to recover my deleted files
    We do not support the recovery of deleted files. Please contact your device manufacturer or use your system’s built-in backup and recovery options for further assistance.
